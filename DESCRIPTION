Title: Different models of posterior distributions of adjusted odds ratio
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jinhui Yang(adopted from the Winbugs code first created by Haitao Chu et al.)
Maintainer: Jinhui Yang <yangj2@carleton.edu>
Description: This package generates different posterior distributions of adjusted odds  
    ratio under different priors of sensitivity and specificity, and plots the models side
    by side for comparison. It also provides estimations for the specification of the 
    models using historic data with a non-linear mixed effects model.
